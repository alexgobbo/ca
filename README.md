# Development

The project can be build by executing
 * Linux: `./gradlew build`
 * Windows: `gradlew.bat build`

The only prerequisite for building this project is a Java >= 8 installed on your machine.

Note: The first time you execute this command the required jars for the build system will be automatically downloaded and the build will start afterwards. The next time you execute the command the build should be faster.
